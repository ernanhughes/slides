### 📐 Sessions and Templates  

A session is a focused interaction with the AI usually with a goal in mind. It might be a single question, a free-flowing brainstorm, or a longer back and forth that can span hours days or just minutes. It allows you to organize and catalog your interactions with AI.

We encourage you to use a **template** a structure for your session. A template helps you focus on what matters, clarify your own thinking, and gives the AI the context it needs to be more effective. It doesn’t restrict the session it just gives it form.  

In most cases, a good session begins by naming what’s going on, setting a goal, and then moving into open conversation. You can optionally include a **prompting template** which is a way to guide or program the interaction. We’ll explain those soon.  

For now, just know that using a session template gives your interaction a shape. And when your interaction has shape, it tends to get sharper and more useful.  

As we progress through the book, we’ll explore these ideas in more detail. But just using this combination a structured session and an optional prompting technique can drastically improve your results right now.  

This will transform how you interact with AI, enabling you to achieve things you never thought possible. This process will deepen your understanding of your own thinking and the AI’s reasoning, unlocking unparalleled levels of clarity, insight, and collaboration that many never discover.  

That’s what this book is here to teach you. And it starts now.  

> 🔍 Quick distinction:
> A **session template** is the overall structure of your conversation how you begin, explore, and close it.
> A **prompting technique** is like a reusable program for communication a kind of algorithm that helps the AI reason, respond, or perform better on a specific kind of task.
> You can use one without the other but when they’re combined, they create a powerful dynamic for deep, focused interaction.

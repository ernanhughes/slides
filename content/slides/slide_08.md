### 🌐 A Spectrum of Use

Whether you’ve just started using AI or you’re already building complex tools, it all comes back to one idea:

> The more clearly and fully you express your intent, the more the machine can help you build something meaningful.

Use cases range from:

- Emails and resumes
- Outlines and blog posts
- Polished responses
- Brainstorms and captions
- Code scaffolds and tools
- Research questions and summaries
- Entire chapters, strategies, or systems

Wherever you are on that spectrum, this book shows you how to go further  
by applying a process designed to unlock more moments of **amplified creation**:  
those ~~rare~~ times when you build something better, faster, or deeper than you thought possible.

### 🤝 Alignment: Getting the Best Work from the AI  

Once you’ve started talking freely, there’s one more thing that makes a huge difference:  

**Getting aligned.**  

Most AIs are designed to be helpful and agreeable. That means they’ll often say “yes” to your ideas, even if those ideas are unclear, incomplete, or could be improved. That’s not a bug it’s just how they’re trained.  

If you want to build, write, design, plan, or think clearly then you don’t just want agreement.  

You want **collaboration**. You want the AI to challenge what’s weak, ask better questions, and push the work to a higher level.  

That’s what alignment is about.  

It means saying to the AI:  
> “I’m not here for surface answers. I want us to do the best work we can. If I drift, bring me back. If something’s unclear, ask. If I miss something, point it out. Let’s build this together.”  

When you start a session like this or even just remind the AI halfway through it shifts the tone of the whole conversation. You stop being the only one pushing. The AI starts carrying weight too.  

You’re no longer just asking.  

You’re **co-creating**.  

That’s the kind of interaction this book is trying to unlock. And this is where it begins.

### ⏳ Why Now?

This moment is different.

For decades, computers could only do what we told them. Then language models emerged. Suddenly, we could talk to them not code them, not click them *talk* to them.

The missing piece wasn’t intelligence. It was **interface**.

This is the first time you can think with your machine not just operate it.  
You don’t need to be a developer. You don’t need perfect prompts.  
You just need a goal and a willingness to speak.

> Only recently have the models become intelligent enough to make this kind of interaction possible.

This book gives you the structure, the techniques, and the mental habits to turn that conversation into results.

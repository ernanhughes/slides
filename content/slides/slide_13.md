### 🗣️ One More Thing: Talk to the Machine

Before you turn the page, open your assistant ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any model you like and just talk.

Not a prompt. Not a command.

Just say what you think about AI right now.

> Try something like:  
> *“I’ve just started a book on using AI differently. Here’s what I think AI is. Here’s how I expect to use it. Here’s what I’m unsure about…”*

You don’t need to get it right. Just describe where you’re at your assumptions, your doubts, your hopes.

Then save that conversation.

**This is your starting point.**

We’re asking you to do this because we believe that by the time you reach the end of this book, your sense of what AI is and how it fits into your work and life will be completely different.

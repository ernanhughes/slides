## Chapter 1: You’ve Probably Already Felt It

> “If you want something new, you have to stop doing something old.”

You’ve probably done it already.

You had to write a tricky email. Respond to a complaint. Explain something you didn’t want to explain. You opened ChatGPT jotted down your thoughts, hit enter and boom. It came back with something surprisingly useful. Not perfect, maybe, but something to work with.

Just like that, the job that felt heavy five minutes ago was already halfway done.

That’s **amplified creation**.
